# YOLO- You Only Look Once
A single convolutional network simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance. This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection. First, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection as a regression problem we donâ€™t need a complex pipeline. We simply run our neural network on a new image at test time to predict detections.
